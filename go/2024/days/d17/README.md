# Advent of code challenge 2024, in GO, day d17

Here is a detailed explanation of what the `part2` does:

It performs a **search or exploration** task over a sequence of states of 3-bit sequences, using a **breadth-first search (BFS) approach**. It iterates through possible values of a parameter `a` (constructed from chunks of 3 bits), runs a virtual machine (`ReRun` function), and attempts to match the machine's output with a specific criterion.

---

### **1. Initialization**

- The function starts by parsing the input lines (`lines`) into a virtual machine (`vm`) and extracting its initial state (`a`, `b`, `c`).
- It initializes a `queue` with potential starting states, represented as `State` objects containing segments (`segs`). The initial states are constructed with values `[0, 1, 2, ..., 7]`, corresponding to all possible 3-bit values (0–7).

---

### **2. BFS-like Search**

- The function iteratively processes states from the `queue`. For each state:
  - **Reconstruct the value of `a`:** It computes a `uint64` value `a` by concatenating the 3-bit segments (`segs`) of the state, where each segment is shifted into the appropriate position.
  - **Run the virtual machine (`ReRun`):** It runs the virtual machine with the computed `a` and the original `b` and `c` values. This simulates the behavior of the machine for the current state.
  - **Check Output:** The function compares the machine’s output (`vm.out`) with the last elements of a reference code (`vm.code`) using the helper function `sliceIntEqualsLast`. If they match and the output length matches the code length, the current value of `a` is returned as the solution.

---

### **3. State Expansion**

- If the output partially matches but does not yet satisfy the criteria, the function expands the current state by appending new 3-bit values (`[0, 1, ..., 7]`) to the front of the current segments.
- These new states are added to the `queue`, ensuring further exploration.

---

### **4. Termination**

- The function continues processing states until:
  - A matching `a` is found, in which case the function returns the decimal representation of `a`.
  - The `queue` becomes empty, indicating that no solution exists (in this case, it returns an empty string).

---

### **Helper Function**

The `sliceIntEqualsLast` function checks if the second slice (`l2`) matches the last elements of the first slice (`l1`), ensuring proper alignment and sequence matching. This is crucial for determining whether the machine’s output satisfies the problem's constraints.
