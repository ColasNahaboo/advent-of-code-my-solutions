# Advent of code solutions in GO
Here are my solutions to the "Advent of code" challenges implemented in GO. See https://adventofcode.com/

I discovered "advent of code" in 2021, and did it in [bash](../) for the challenge. But since I started learning GO, I decided to code the previous AoC years in GO as a mean to practice it. So, although my bash code can be useful to see some tricks of a seasoned bash programmer, these GO solutions must be considered as "student code".

The code is in GO, with some housekeeping scripts in bash.
