# Advent of code solutions in bash
Here are my solutions to the "Advent of code" challenges implemented in bash. See https://adventofcode.com/

I tried to implement "smart" bash solutions, that rely on fast GNU/Linux utilities like grep, sed, sort... (the way I use bash in real life), but most of the time my goal was readability and compliance with shellcheck, not terseness or efficiency. I am an old (retired) proficient bash programmer, so my goal here is not to learn bash, but rather un-learn some bad dirty habits accumulated over the years and force myself to code in a "shellcheck-friendly" modern way.

Although I invented, designed and implemented a commercial programming language and worked professionnally with "real" languages, I grew in love with bash because the intellectual challenges it poses to write efficient code, making mundane tasks exciting, and that it (nearly) never breaks backwards compatibility, a code that runs now will run in 20 years and more...
